## Information on running the code
- The only code file is `main.py`.
- I have used type declarations for the sake of readability for variables and functions, so `please use Python 3.5+`.
- I have used `Python 3.6`.
- Run it with command like this: `python main.py <filename>`.
- Each output is printed on a new line.
